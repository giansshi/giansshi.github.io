			<center><h2>Domestic Violence in homes during lockdown</h2></center>
				
			<p>As millions of Filipinos are ordered to stay home to stop the spread of coronavirus, several rights groups warned against the likely rise in domestic 
			violence and child abuse cases at home. The Commission on Human Rights Philippines said with the imposition of the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine and 
			provincial lockdowns, women and children who experience physical, psychological, and sexual abuse are trapped inside the homes they share with their abusers. Sadly, 
			authorities revealed in June that this statistic has risen since Covid-19 lockdowns began in March this year. The Philippines’ figures are consistent with a World 
			Health Organization report that says violence against women has increased during this year’s pandemic because couples are spending more time together at home. 
			Stress has also been a big factor during the pandemic and is often brought about by the loss of a job and health fears. <br> <br> The study also found that the 
			vulnerabilities of women and girls worsened because of the health crisis. It noted that the attention to and resources for women’s health had been diverted by the 
			rising number of Covid-19 cases.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Prevention of this includes:</h2>
			<ol><p>
				<li><h3>Know the signs</h3>-Be wary of the following red flags an abuser may exhibit at any point in a relationship.</li>
				<li><h3>Don’t ignore it</h3>-If you hear your neighbors engaged in a violent situation, call the police. It could save a life.</li>
				<li><h3>Lend an ear</h3>-If someone ever confides in you they are experiencing domestic violence, listen without judgment.</li>
				<li><h3>Be available</h3>-If someone you know is thinking about leaving or is in fear the violence will escalate, be ready to help.</li>
				<li><h3>Know the number to a nearby shelter</h3>-You never know who might need refuge in a hurry.</li>
				<li><h3>Check in regularly</h3>-If a loved one or friend is in danger, reach out regularly to ensure his or her safety.</li>
				<li><h3>Be a resource</h3>-Offer to do the legwork to help ease stress and keep things confidential.</li>
				<li><h3>Write it down</h3>-Document every incident you witness and include the date, time, location, injuries and circumstances.</li>
				<li><h3>Get the word out</h3>-Assist a local shelter or domestic violence organization in their efforts to raise awareness in your community.</li>
				<li><h3>Put your money where your mouth is</h3>-Use your power as a consumer and refuse to support the culture perpetuated in music, movies, television, games and the media that glorifies violence, particularly against women.</li>
