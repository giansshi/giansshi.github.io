		<h1>-----Poverty in the Philippines-----</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div id="redvelvet">
		<p>Poverty and inequality in the Philippines remains a challenge. In the past four decades, the proportion of households 
		living below the official poverty line has declined slowly and unevenly and poverty reduction has been much slower than in neighboring countries 
		such as the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Economic growth has gone through boom and bust cycles, and recent 
		episodes of moderate economic expansion have had limited impact on the poor. Great inequality across income brackets, regions, and sectors, as well as 
		unmanaged population growth, are considered some of the key factors constraining poverty reduction efforts.</p>

		<p>Economic growth has gone through boom and bust cycles, and recent episodes of moderate economic expansion have had limited impact on the poor. 
		Great inequality across income brackets, regions, and sectors, as well as unmanaged population growth, are considered some of the key factors constraining poverty 
		reduction efforts.

		<br>
		Causes of Poverty. The main causes of poverty in the country include the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Low to moderate economic growth for the past 40 years.</li>
			<li>Low growth elasticity of poverty reduction.</li>
			<li>Weakness in employment generation and the quality of jobs generated.</li>
			<li>Failure to fully develop the agriculture sector.</li>
			<li>High inflation during crisis periods.</li>
			<li>High levels of population growth.</li>
			<li>High and persistent levels of inequality (incomes and assets), which dampen the positive impacts of economic expansion.</li>
			<li>Recurrent shocks and exposure to risks such as economic crisis, conflicts, natural disasters,and "environmental poverty.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>With poverty plaguing the country and employment opportunities being scarce, many Filipinos are unable to afford housing, which puts them in danger of turning to the 
		streets for accommodation. In 2012, extreme poverty within the Philippines affected 19.2 percent of the population or around 18.4 million people.<br><br>
		Hunger is one of the extreme effects of poverty in the Philippines. With little money to buy food, Filipinos are having to survive on very limited food; even 
		when food supplies are stable, they are most accessible in other areas where people have enough income to purchase the food.<br><br>
		Statistics show that around 3.6 million children, from ages 5-17, are child laborers in the Philippines. This is 15.9 percent of the entire population.<br><br>
		There are too many people and not enough resources. And with such conditions, people become desperate and practice drastic measures to provide for themselves and their families.
		With conditions so troublesome, people often resort to crime and thievery to survive.</p>

			<p>This was created in order to have background about the current social issues and problems in the Philippines, especially during lockdown and during the pandemic 
			where it is definitely harder to adjust to the new normal. Statistics, solutions, and terminologies are also present here for more information.</p>
