				<h2>Unemployment during the Pandemic</h2>
				
				<p>The economy shrank significantly in Q3 according to recent data, albeit at a softer rate than Q2â€™s record downturn. 
				Consumption and fixed investment continued to collapse amid a weak labor market and suppressed sentiment. Moreover, fiscal support dried up, 
				with government spending growth slowing markedly. The external sector contributed to GDP, although this was chiefly due to a collapse in imports 
				on depressed demand. Turning to Q4, conditions are likely still downbeat. The manufacturing PMI slipped back into contractionary territory in 
				October on a renewed fall in new orders. Moreover, Covid-19 restrictions linger, while the country has been lashed by devastating typhoons in 
				weeks, causing economic disruption and likely hurting the agricultural sector. In addition, although a USD 3.4 billion stimulus package was introduced 
				in September, spending execution has so far been lackluster.</p> <br>
				
				<p>The unemployment rate in the Philippines surged to 8.7 percent in the December quarter of 2020 from 4.5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier, 
				amid the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis. The number of unemployed persons surged by 1.77 thousand to 3.81 million, while the number of 
				employed dropped by 2.70 thousand to 39.84 million. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate was down to 58.7 in the fourth quarter from 61.4 the prior year. 
				Among employed persons, workers in the services sector made up 57.2 percent of the total, followed by those in the agriculture sector (24.5 percent) 
				and industry (18.3 percent).<p>

			<h2>Solutions for Unemployment</h2>
			<h5>Reducing Occupational Immobility</h5>
			<p>-Labour resources are usually occupationally immobile because it takes time for people to gain the sufficient skills that are necessary for working in a certain 
			industry. Hence, the government can provide retraining programmes for the unemployed, so that they can improve their skills or gain new skills necessary to ensure their 
			employment.<p>
			<h5>Employment Subsidies</h5>
			<p>-Employment subsidies can be provided by the government for firms who hire workers that are unemployed. With a subsidy, costs of production for firms go down since 
			the price of each unit of labour resource decreases. Hence, employers will be more willing and able to hire more workers and increase the number of workers that they are
			willing to hire. However, it is difficult for governments to determine how much subsidy to provide and it is difficult to ensure that firms are willing to retain the 
			increased size of their workforce when there are changes in the economy.<p>
			<h5>Sustained Economic Growth</h5>
			<p>-Having sustained economic growth is another way for the government to address the problem of unemployment. When there is economic growth, employers will be more 
			willing and able to employ more workers. This helps to address the issue of unemployment. However, this is a long term strategy that takes a lot of time to see results.<p>

				<p>This was created in order to have background about the current social issues and problems in the Philippines, especially during lockdown and during the pandemic 
				where it is definitely harder to adjust to the new normal. Statistics, solutions, and terminologies are also present here for more information.</p>
